# Cleanup Drive Dataset

This repository contains a dataset for **community cleanup drive verification**.  
The dataset is divided into two main folders:

- **`before/`** → Images taken *before* a cleanup activity.  
- **`after/`** → Images taken *after* the cleanup activity at the same location.  



## File Naming Convention
- Each cleanup activity pair shares a common **ID number**.  
- Example:  
  - `img14.png` → Corresponding pre-cleanup image.  
  - `img14.png` → Corresponding post-cleanup image.  

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Computer vision tasks such as **change detection**, **scene verification**, and **image comparison**.  
- Training AI/ML models for automated cleanup verification (before vs. after).
